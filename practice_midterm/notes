dig @100.64.11.2 www.dundermifflin.com

curl --resolv www.dundermifflin.com:80:100.64.11.3 http://www.dundermifflin.com/index.html

ssh root@100.64.0.11

start:

unable to connect to any servers from machinea with dig/ssh. error 22, no route

on machineb: listening port was set to 51 instead of 53 in /etc/named.conf

systemctl status named has an error
"BIND Unable to fetch DNSKEY set '.': timed out"

this might be okay.

updated the nftables on machinea, started the dhcpd service on machinea, rebooted machineb.

unable to curl dundermifflin.com. connection refused
fixed a small typo on machinec's /etc/apache2/apache2.conf
restarted apache2 service, now works great.
