<H1>Schrute Farms Bed &amp; Breakfast</H1>
For a truly rustic getaway, look no farther than this adorable Honesdale beet
farm, which now houses an ultra-comfy bed and breakfast. Nestled away on 1,600
pristine acres, this Civil War Era landmark offers much coveted privacy along
with an almost endless list of fun and exciting farm activities.

<h3>Stay at Schrute Farms</h3>
Schrute Farms offers three unique, agriculturally inspired guestrooms &ndash;
America, Irrigation and Nighttime. Each room features hand-stuffed, hand-woven
mattresses, precious, historical Schrute family photographs and vivid,
beet-dyed, hand stitched quilts.
<h3>Things to Do</h3>
With farm-specific amenities like an authentic under-porch restroom, a
possum-taxidermy gallery and intricately carved beet-work sculptures that seem
to jump out at you, it&rsquo;s obvious no expense was spent to provide such an
oddly remarkable experience.

<p>
The activities are customizable and endless. Choose to spend the morning distributing manure, planting beets or attending the free Beet Lecture Series hosted by Mr. Schrute himself. Fill your afternoons with highly informative classes like table making, beet wine making, proper hoeing or attend the free Beet Lecture Series session II.
<p>Finally, as evening draws near and the goose walk commences, settle in for a
hearty supper. Your taste buds will literally jump off your tongue as you dig
into old beet farm classics like Borscht or beet-stuffed jack rabbit. Pair your
entrees with a bottle of proprietary beet wine and be sure to save room for the
peanut butter and chocolate, sweet beet sundae.
<p>As the farm succumbs to darkness, nestle into your hand-stuffed bed, opt for
the nighttime story and doze off as Mr. Schrute gently reads to you from Harry
Potter and The Deathly Hollows.

<strong>Stay away - proprietor is crazy!</strong><br> I have to warn people about
the proprietor of Schrute Farms - he may portray himself as a gentleman farmer,
but he is not what he seems! He killed my cat, sprinkles!!!  Who knows what he
might do to you or your loved ones....

<strong>Schrute Farms delivers!</strong><br>
The architecture reminds one of a quaint Tuscan beet farm, and the natural
aroma of the beets drifts into the bedrooms and makes you dream of simpler
times. You will never want to leave your room.  The informative lecture will
satisfy all your beet curiosity, and the dawn goose walk will tug at your heart
strings. Table making never seemed so possible. Great story to tell your
friends. Plenty of parking! The staff's attention to detail and devotion to
cleanliness was limitless. From their enthusiastic welcome to the last wave
good-bye, Schrute Farms delivers.
