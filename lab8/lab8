1. On Machined E, create a single Linux LVM partition on each of the new drives.

> sudo fdisk /dev/sdb
> n
> p
> default partition number
> default first sector
> default last sector
> t
> 8e (Linux LVM)
> w (write)

2. Create a volume group named savg that uses all the newly added storage.

> sudo vgcreate savg /dev/sdb1

3. Create a logical volume tmp that is 1GB in size and create an ext4 file system on it.

> sudo lvcreate -n tmp -L 1G savg
(-n name, -L size)
> sudo mkfs.ext4 /dev/savg/temp

4. Create a logical volume home that fills 80% of the remainder of the newly added storage and create an xfs file system on it.

> sudo lvcreate -n home -l 80%FREE savg
> sudo mkfs.xfs /dev/savg/home

5. Permanently add the new /tmp and /home filesystems to the root file system.  Use the nodev, nosuid and noexec mount options for /tmp and the nodev mount option for /home.

> mkdir /mnt/temp
> mkdir /mnt/home
> vi /etc/fstab
append lines
/dev/savg/tmp           /mnt/tmp                ext4    defaults,nodev,nosuid,noexec    0 0
/dev/savg/home          /mnt/home               xfs     defaults,nodev  0 0
> mount -a (mounts all filesystems in fstab)

6. Implement quotas on /home to limit the amount of storage that any Dunder-Mifflin employee may use to a soft limit of 1000MB, a hard limit of 1200MB and a grace period of 1 day.  Apply the same limits to the managers, accounting and sales groups.

I did not do this :O

Didn't take too long, actually. Less than an hour. I imagine it would have taken substantially longer if I were a
grad student and had to fiddle with RAID. Or if I had done the EC.
